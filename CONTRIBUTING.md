## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug in the code or an error in the database entries:

* **Search existing issues** to see if it has already been reported.
* If not, **open a new issue**. Include:
* A clear, descriptive title.
* Steps to reproduce the error.
* Expected vs. actual behavior.
* Screenshots or error logs if applicable.



### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for new features, additional metabolic pathways, or improved data visualization:

* Open an issue with the tag `enhancement`.
* Explain why this feature would be useful to the broader research community.

### Data Contributions

Since FAMeDB is a specialized database, data integrity is paramount. If you wish to contribute new aromatic compound metabolism data:

1. If possible ensure data is formatted according to the existing schema in the `FAMeDB_curation_data.tsv` file.
2. Provide the original source (DOI and acc. no.) for the information.
3. Submit via a Pull Request (see below).

---

### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure your code follows the project's style.
4. Update the `README.md` or documentation if you are changing functionality.
5. Issue a **Pull Request (PR)** to the `main` branch.
6. Link the PR to any relevant issues (e.g., "Closes #123").
7. A maintainer from the **Silva-Pereira Lab** will review your changes. Be prepared to address feedback.
